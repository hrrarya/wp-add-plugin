# WP Plugin Boilerplate CLI

A CLI tool to automate the setup of new WordPress plugins with React.js setup. It simplifies the process by taking inputs and replacing boilerplate code, saving developers time and effort. No more manual editing of plugin names, text domains, or other repetitive tasksâ€”let the CLI handle it for you!

---

## Features
- Automates replacing boilerplate code with user-provided inputs.
- Speeds up the setup process for WordPress plugin development.
- Easy-to-use and interactive CLI interface.

## Installation

To use `wp-add-plugin`, you need to install it globally on your machine.

```bash
npm install -g wp-add-plugin
```

This command makes the CLI tool globally accessible on your system.

## Usage

### Step 1: Start the CLI
Run the following command in the terminal within your plugin directory:

```bash
wp-add-plugin
```

### Step 2: Follow the Prompts
The CLI will guide you through the setup process by asking for specific inputs:
1. **Plugin Name**: Enter the name of your plugin (e.g., "My Awesome Plugin").
2. **Text Domain**: Specify the text domain for your plugin (e.g., "my-awesome-plugin").
3. **Namespace**: Define the namespace for your PHP classes (recommended).
4. **Constant Prefix**: Define the Constant Prefix for your PHP files (recommended).

The CLI will automatically:
- Update the plugin name and text domain in all relevant files.
- Replace placeholders in the boilerplate code with your inputs.
- Set up your plugin folder structure.

### Step 3: Start Developing
Once the CLI finishes, your new WordPress plugin is ready. Open the generated files in your favorite code editor and start building!
